# Deployment Guide for React SPA Routing

This project has been configured to handle client-side routing properly across different hosting platforms.

## What was fixed:

The 404 error on page refresh occurs because React Router uses client-side routing, but the server doesn't know to serve `index.html` for all routes. 

## Files created/modified:

1. **`vite.config.ts`** - Enhanced with preview configuration
2. **`public/_redirects`** - For Netlify, Vercel, and other platforms
3. **`public/.htaccess`** - For Apache servers
4. **`public/vercel.json`** - Specific configuration for Vercel
5. **`public/netlify.toml`** - Specific configuration for Netlify
6. **`public/nginx.conf`** - Sample nginx configuration

## How to deploy:

### For most platforms:
1. Run `npm run build` to generate the `dist` folder
2. Deploy the `dist` folder contents
3. The appropriate configuration file will be automatically used

### Platform-specific:

#### Netlify:
- Deploy the `dist` folder
- `_redirects` file will be used automatically

#### Vercel:
- Deploy the `dist` folder  
- `vercel.json` file will be used automatically

#### Apache servers:
- Deploy `dist` folder
- Ensure `.htaccess` is copied to the root of your deployment

#### Nginx:
- Use the provided `nginx.conf` configuration
- Adjust paths as needed for your setup

## Testing locally:

After building, you can test the production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then navigate to different routes and refresh - they should work without 404 errors.

## Important notes:

- All hosting platforms handle SPA routing slightly differently
- The configuration ensures that any non-API route serves `index.html`
- Your React Router will then handle the routing on the client side
- API routes (if any) are excluded from the fallback
